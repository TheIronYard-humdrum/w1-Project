#### [Week 1](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project) Project - HTML & CSS - Build Full Layout
---
##### Just beginning to learn HTML & CSS
---

* Normal Mode - [Subscription Service](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project/tree/master/normal-mode)
* Hard Mode - [Skinny Ties](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project/tree/master/hard-mode)
* If both above links work I've accomplished NIGHTMARE MODE!

##### [Normal Mode](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project/tree/master/normal-mode)
* Attempted to use `<ul>` instead of `<nav>` to create layout for Plan Specs but had too much trouble styling.  Try other implementations for `<ul>`.
* Border Radius, Forms, Buttons.
* Problem of Scrolling Background - Solved by using CSS to style `background-image: url("./background.jpg")` instead of `<img>` tag in HTML.
* Problem of Scrolling Div - Solved by using `overflow: hidden;`.

##### [Hard Mode](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project/tree/master/hard-mode)
* Learned proficiency with sprites and psuedo tags.
* Problem:  content not showing in psuedo tags. Solution: don't forget the `content: "" ;`.
* Practice using `zoom`.
