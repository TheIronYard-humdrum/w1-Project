---
* Normal Mode - [Subscription Service](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project/tree/master/normal-mode)
* Hard Mode - [Skinny Ties](https://github.com/jjrajani/w1-Project/tree/master/hard-mode)
* If both above links work I've accomplished NIGHTMARE MODE!

##### Normal Mode
* Used `<ul>` instead of `<nav>` to create layout for Plan Specs.
* Border Radius, Forms, Buttons.
* Problem of Scrolling Background - Solved by using CSS to style `background-image: url("./background.jpg")` instead of `<img>` tag in HTML.

##### Hard Mode
* Used this tool.
* Used that tool.
* Had this problem, fixed it this way.
